# Hypothyroid Prediction
## Overview
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism's deficiency of thyroid hormones can disrupt such things as heart rate, body temperature and all aspects of metabolism. Hypothyroidism is most prevalent in older women.

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. From the data collected during the tests, we are to build a model that will predict whether a patient has hypothyroidsm based on the symptoms provided.

Given the data, we are to build a machine learning model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
### Our Metric for success
Being able to correctly predict hypothyroidsm in a patient by building a machine learning model using at least 2 out of the 3 advanced models: Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees. We will also use the SVM model.

We will then decide which of the models will be most suitable for prediction by evaluating the models accuracy.
